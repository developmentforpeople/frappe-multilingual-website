# Multilanguage website example based on Frappe Framework

I want to help all people with multilingual website needs based on wonderful [Frappe Framwork](https://frappeframework.com/).

If you do not know [Frappe](https://frappeframework.com/) yet, please give it an opportunity, you are going to love it. And if you have a company or work with companies, you should take a look to their excelent Open Source ERP called [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/), it is a must.

Thank you very much to all people making [Frappe](https://frappeframework.com/) & [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/) possible :).
